Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    My class is meant to represent the class for a "player" or "user" object in a escape room like game. It has a constuctor that creates the player object. The player has a name, inventory and size. The player can interact with items by, grabbing them, dropping them, examining them and using them. Some items, such as those in the room (storage) have specific effects. Wings allow the player to fly, cake allows you to grow and the bottle allows you to grow. For now, the class just prints to the terminal a sentence explaining what the method did. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    I did not implement any addition classes because I did not believe we could until I read this (oops!).

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    If I had more time I would have expanded on this assignment by creating other classes such as a room, for the player to walk, fly and grab objects in. Each object in the room would have its own class with its own attributes. This would enable the methods in Player with a return to return to something, rather than how it currently just prints to the terminal.
